Hey there!

My name is Samarth Arul. I'm an undergraduate at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am particularly interested in software, fintech, and venture. This summer, I'll be interning at the Options Clearing Corporation in Chicago. Previously, I've interned/worked at Kitchen Kapital (Engineering Intern), the Institute for Policy Research (Research Assistant), Illinois Tech (Research Intern), and Noodles & Company (Cashier and Pasta Enthusiast).

Shoot me an email at SamarthArul [at] gmail [dot] com.
