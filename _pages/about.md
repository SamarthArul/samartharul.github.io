Hey there!

My name is Samarth Arul. I'm an undergraduate at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am particularly interested in distributed systems, computer networks, and cloud computing. During Summer 2024, I'll be interning at the [Options Clearing Corporation](https://www.theocc.com) in Chicago. 

Previously, I've interned/worked at [Kitchen Kapital](https://www.thegarage.northwestern.edu/programs/the-residency-program) (Engineering Intern), the [Institute for Policy Research](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/) (Research), [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu/) (Research), and [Noodles & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodles_%26_Company) (Cashier and Pasta Enthusiast).

I'm always looking for exciting technical problems to solve -- contact me at SamarthArul@gmail.com.
