Welcome.

I am an undergraduate at Northwestern studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am particularly interested in software, venture, and start-ups. I am currently working to democratize small-business financing at Kitchen Kapital (Jumpstart '23).

You can reach me at SamarthArul [at] gmail [dot] com.
